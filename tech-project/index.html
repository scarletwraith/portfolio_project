        <p>AI is a fast moving development, but it's currently limited by a few factors. One of the big factors currently is maintaining the needs for global AI use. ChatGPT alone uses an estimated 39.16 million gallons of water per day globally for necessary cooling.</p>

        <p>Quantum computing has been a topic of discussion for a good while now, but what even is quantum computing, and why is it important? The computers we know today store information using bits that are either 0 or 1. Quantum computing takes this same idea and upgrades it using something called qubits. These qubits are different, because they can be both 0 and 1 at the same time and linking qubits to each other to solve problems using quantum physics. This means that quantum computers will be able solve problems faster than today's computing and even handle problems that today's computing can't.</p>

        <p>As AI gets used more and more, college students and tech developers aren't the only people utilizing its logical thinking abilities. Hackers are starting to use AI for their various needs as well. This makes cybersecurity much more difficult to manage. In situations like this, we have to fight fire with fire and implement AI into cybersecurity.</p>
