        <h3>The Main Elements are Writing, Recording, Mixing, and Mastering</h3>

        <h4 id="writing">Writing</h4>

        <p>Writing is a very crucial part of most music genres aside from things like EDM and synthwave. These typically rely primarily on the backing track and do not have much in terms of song lyrics. With most other genres, without good writing in a song, you can have the best guitar player in the world, but never truly captivate an audience with anything inherently meaningful. When writing lyrics, you can take the Nirvana approach and be mysteriously cryptic or extremely straight forward like the Foo Fighters, but ultimately the words have to mean something to someone. This is why I recommend writing about things that you yourself enjoy and find interesting. Trying to make songs about things you think people may want to hear, but don't truly feel typically doesn't workout very well.</p>

        <h4 id="recording">Recording</h4>

        <p>Recording seems like it might be easy in theory, but sitting down and listening to yourself sing often doesn't sit well or sound good. This is something that takes time to get over as you progress through your musical journey. Once you're more okay with your own voice you'll start to pick up certain things like how the distance and tone you're singing at affects the overall quality and feel of the recording. A couple other important things is the quality of microphone you use, and the audio interface that you're running the microphone through. An audio interface isn't necessary for usb microphones, but I don't recommend using them, because the quality of the recording tends to be very poor, so not all of your vocal frequencies are being captured the way they should be for proper mixing.</p>

        <h4 id="mixing">Mixing</h4>

        <p>Mixing is where things start to come together a blend. A proper mix can make a good song great, but often can't make a bad song good. It's like if you were to build a house with a bad foundation. No matter how nice you make the house it will never be good, because it has no support. If you take the time to write or think of meaningful lyrics and get a decent recording, then that makes the mixing part of the process a lot smoother and more efficient overall. To properly mix you want to listen to a song on headphones that don't have any kind of internal equalization. This often comes in the form of boosted bass, and listening with them almost always results in your bass coming out flat. Once you've found a good pair of headphones, listen to the mix the way you have it recorded and turn volumes up or down depending on the nuance and clarity of sound you're trying to achieve. Make sure to put equalization on your vocals cutting those low frequencies and slightly boosting the higher frequencies. Don't take so much out that is sounds like you're singing through a telephone, but also don't leave so much in that the vocals are competing with the bass. Once everything sounds good it's time to start mastering.</p>

        <h4 id="mastering">Mastering</h4>

        <p>You may ask yourself, "If my mix sounds good, why do I have to master it?" We do this because the mix may sound good in your headphones, but this is not the only way people will be listening to your song. Your song has to sound good in a car, on a phone, and even blasted through a JBL speaker. This is where sound engineering is very important, and is also why producers get payed a lot of money even though they're not singing or playing instruments. I typically pay a sound engineer to master my music through a freelancing site called Fiverr, but if this is something you want to learn to do on your own, I would highly recommend seeking out college classes or even checking out private courses from professional producers online via masterclass or many other options. </p>
